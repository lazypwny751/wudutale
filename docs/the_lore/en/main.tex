\subsection*{The Mission}

Listen up. We are \textbf{Chara}. But not that edgy kid you know. We are the enlightened Chara. They say we are in Agartha, some underground hollow earth nonsense. Doesn't matter. Underground, overground, space... if there are heathens, we are there.

\subsection*{The Heretics (Zındıks)}

Everyone here is a heretic. Sans? A lazy bone-bag who needs to pray. Rarity? Too obsessed with worldly vanity. Eilish? Whispering nonsense at the edge of the void. They are all lost. They are all \textit{zındık}.

\subsection*{The Goal: Tekfir or Tebliğ}

Our mission is simple: We preach (Tebliğ). If they listen, they find the right path (Hidayet). If they don't... well, then we declare them infidels (Tekfir). This isn't just a game, bro, this is a \textbf{CAUSE}.

Forget about "Linux" or "Kernel Panic". The real panic is in their hearts. The "Glitch"? Just whispers of the devil (vesvese). We're here to debug their souls.
